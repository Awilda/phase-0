<h3>GPS 1.1 Reflection</h3>

**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I had trouble with pull and merge prior to my GPS session. It turned out that that was one of the challenges we'd be working with.


**What was clarified during the GPS?**

I had trouble with pull and merge prior to my GPS session. It turned out that that was one of the challenges we'd be working with. So now I understand how to pull a repository from Github to my computer and how to merge on Github.


**What (if anything) was made more confusing?**

I'm left a little lost with pulling from my terminal and when I'm supposed to do so. I will definitely get help from the community.


**How was your first experience of pairing in a guided pairing session?**

My first experience with GPS was splendid. I hope the next ones are as informative and comfortable as this one. My peer and I were so focused, we worked for an extra hour.


**Was having a guide there intimidating? helpful? reassuring?**

At first I thought having a guide would be very intimidating until I realized it was just a voice. I didn't have to see someone else's facial expression to determine if I was going a decent job or not. We were able to ask him some questions prior to and during our session. But after a while, I pretty much forgot and before I knew it he had to go. 


**What were your 'aha' moments?**

My 'aha' moment was actually seeing my work and my partner's work up on the same repository. We were able to make changes, merge and create a merge conflict in which we had to chose one file. It was pretty sweet seeing how developer use those tools.

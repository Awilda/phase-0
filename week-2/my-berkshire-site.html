<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was really neat! I learned HTML earlier this year but I hadn't played around with it for some months
so it was a refresher. It felt good to continue learning the html syntax.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Researching HTML5 wasn't so difficult because all the results immediately pointed to HTML5. I'm not sure I know the difference between HTML and HTML5 because I started learning HTML5 right away. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think I did pretty well. I didn't feel the need to do any formatting. I enjoyed figuring out the syntax with my peer and learned how to use span properly

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good about HTML is that it sets a structure for your page. The bad is that you can style right on it if you wanted to which isn't as clean and would be extra work if you're styling multiple pages.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
My way of learning how to write HTML is by simply playing around with it.

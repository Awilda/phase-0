**What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is your idea for your website's layout. Whether you're drawing it by paper or computer, you 
can place each piece of your website where you want it to be.


**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

Wireframing is a great visual tool. It puts to paper what ideas are going on in our minds and then serves
as a guideline when building the actual website. 


**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

Wireframing my site was a blast! I am a planner so being able to go to the next step after site mapping was exciting. Just when I had one idea, the articles provided made me think outside the box to cook up new ideas.  Sketching a bunch of wireframe thumbnails helped me brainstorm. I feel pretty good about this challenge but am a little discouraged about my artistic abilities. 


**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I continue to want to revise my wireframe and probably will continue making some changes in the future. My current challenge is not knowing if I can execute my idea. 


**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

While creating several wireframe thumbnails I started out with my more eccentric ideas and then to simpler ones. Through that I was able to find an in-between however, I'm still unsure if it's something that can be done by me.


**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I enjoyed creating many variations of wireframes for my home page and blog. I didn't like a lot of the wireframe sources I found and balsamiq doesn't download for linux so, I spent a lot of time trying out these sources that didn't work out for me. At the end of the day, I ended up sketching it. My perfectionist side insisted on using a ruler but I knew it would take even longer so I just went for it.

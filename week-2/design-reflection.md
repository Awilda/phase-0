**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

1. Information Gathering - understand business and designer's needs
2. Planning - creation of site-map
3. Design - creation of protype(s)
4. Development - creation of website
5. Testing and Delivery - compatability, valid code, functionality tests
6. Maintenance - editing on a regular basis


**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

The purpose of my site is to showcase my portfolio with a touch of my personality. Content for the site will include: Bio, Blog, Contact, Portfolio, Social Network links and DIY. I'm thinking of finding a more interactive navigating system using pictures with links. 


**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

My target audience consists of potential employers who want to see more about me through my site. They are interested in my coding which they could find throuhh my Gihub link as well as how my site is executed. My target audience will also want to find originality which I hope to show through my web design, voice in my blog and DIY page.


**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

I want my site to be easily accessible yet pleasing to the eye. I think my users will find my site to be full of color, organized and informative. I want to grab the user's attention with possible simple animation that will tempt them to interact with every single page. I hope to be contacted with feedback and emails.


**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

- It won't work for every situation but it can be designed to fit specific needs
- There's no definite way to measure it
- UX is seen as useless to some


**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

I learned that user experience is the user's relationship to a system. This is based on accessibility, productivity and service. I also now know the basic design and user experience process. Those are: Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery and Maintenance. 

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

Being able to plan my site and generate a site-map was so much fun. Although, I don't feel a complete grasp to the basic process, I believe practicing it will allow me to understand it better. I was especially curious about the testing because I've never done that. I'm comfortable enought with each of the Learning Competencies in this challenge. I really enjoyed planning out my site especially since I'm full of so many ideas. I take every challenge as a learning experience no matter what. I did have some trouble linking my site map onto this reflection but trying to figure it out and reading on our google community really helped!

Reflection

**What is a one-to-one database?**
A one-to-one database works when two things act as a pair.


**When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**
I would use a one-to-one database when I want to connect information with the primary table that may or may not be empty.


**What is a many-to-many database?**
A many-to-many database is a one-to-one database and one-to-many database combined.


**When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**
I would use this database when I need to join two tables however one of the tables needs extra information that would be stored in another table. However, that other table is only linked to that one table.


**What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?**
So, far it makes sense although I wouldn't say I'm 100% with it because I haven't put it into real life practice.

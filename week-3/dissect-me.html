<!-- 
-What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
Some HTML5 tags that I used and was familiar with were the meta and nav tags. I learned that the meta charset tag allows even foreign characteristics to become readable. The nav tags are a great because you can have a section in your page just for the navigation bar instead of using the section tag or divs.


-How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
The elements get laid our from top to bottom. The browser will read the doctype and know it's an HTML page. Then it will read the content in the html tags from top to bottom. It will read the head tags and display the title while it registers the charset. After, it will read the body and display it in its written order.


-What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned that Sublime even had snippets. I think snippets will come in handy for work that need to have a certain structure. I will definitely research more shortcuts to make life more easier although, I like typing everything out so I can learn it better. But when I do, I'm sure the shortcuts will make the work process faster and smoother.

## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

Once you go onto your Github account, you can click on the '+' sign next to your profile photo on the top right of the screen. When you click it, you will have two options. You will choose 'New Repository.' This will lead you to a new page where you can type the name you want for the repository, description, whether you want it private or not, a README option and licensing options. Once you've filled that out, you will click on the green button at the end of the form that reads, 'create repository.' Now, you will see your repository in your Github and you're ready to clone it. This means you get to have your own copy of this file outside of Github and onto your computer. In order to do this, you will copy the HTTPS code seen on the bottom right of your repository page. After that, you will open up your terminal (a place where you can add files, go through them, send them to Github,etc.) and find the location you want to put this repository into. Type 'git clone' and paste the copied HTTPS url right after. Your new repository on Github and its clone on your computer is now done.

**Describe what open source means.**

Open Source means that your code is in the public eye and that anyone not only see it but use it. Open source licenses allows the original owner to keep copyright of their work while sharing it freely with others to do whatever they please with it. Depending on what kind of license is involved, some requirements include: giving credit to the original source and accompanying the license in all the works made using the original code. Websites that use open source include WordPress and Github.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

 feel that Open Source is a good concept. I seem to notice that programmers enjoy solving problems and making things simpler. Open Source allows others to contribute to your code which can be really helpful using an extra source of mind. I guess it would depend on what project I'm working on to make me feel protective about it. I, however, am a little nervous about it as a student of web development because everyone can see my imperfections in my work. On the other hand, others can also see my growth which shouldn't be a bad thing.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

censes are important in the manner that it's clean and conflict-free. The fact that it also doesn't cost a thing is also a good attribute. It gives credit to the original owner no matter where and how it's shared.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

My 'aha' moment happened as I read the articles on open source licenses, specifically from "A Short Guide To Open-Source and Similar Licenses." I've used Github before and have created repositories but never understood what the 'Add a license' meant. Now I know that the option for licenses vary and I'm now able to look up each license when I'm unsure of its requirement.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

I decided to Google 'Open source sites.' I wanted to understand it better by seeing website examples. I saw Github, BitBucket and Googlecode. However, what I found interesting is that there are also sites such as BeautifulOpen.com where open source is used to create templates(Not just front-end stuff but also for other languages such as Ruby) for sites that anyone is free to use.

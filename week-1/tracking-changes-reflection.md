<h3>Tracking Changes Reflection</h3>

**How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?**

Tracking and adding changes allow developers to keep a record of every change that was ever made.
This is useful when collaborating with other developers where each of their changes is noted and
if something useful gets deleted, there's a way to retrieve it.


**What is a commit?**

Commit saves the untracked file that has been added. When committing, you type a clear message
stating the changes.


**What are the best practices for commit messages**

A good practice for commit messages is writing a present-tense message stating the exact change 
to the file.


**What does the HEAD^ argument mean?**

The Head is the most recent commit, or saved file.


**What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?**

Modified - Changes made 
Committed - Saved 
Staged - Ready to be be pushed into repo


**Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?**

git status : check for untracked files
git add: add untracked files
git commit: save tracked files

**What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?**

A pull request gets all the information of all your previous changes. You create a pull request by clicking on pull request on Github. You can then compare the file of the pull request with your other branch and click merge. Depending on whether or not you are merging with someone else's work determines whether or not you will 
get a merge conflict.

**Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?**

When collaborating developers use pull requests, they are able to track all of their peer's changes. This allows them to see the whole process. It's also really great because if several members of a team decide to merge, the team can see who contributed to what.

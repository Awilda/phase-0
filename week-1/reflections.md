<h2>1.1 Think About Time</h2>

**Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?**

I learned about meditation, the pomodoro technique, timebox, flow, and growth mindset. Meditation is a great technique to refresh your mind and check in with your body. The pomodoro technique is really great. You set a timer for 25 minutes (although you can set your own time too) to work on a task and then stop. With flow, I love when I get into it when I'm doing something so I wanted to learn more about it. I think obtaining flow at is best is when you are in check with your mind and body without any distractions. As far as the growth mindset, this is the mind of a person who is willing to challenge themselves, to continue learning, who is inspired by others and as a result will reach their highest potential.  


**What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?**

Time Boxing is setting yourself a certain amount of time to work on a task. Once the time is up, you can reflect on the work you did or take a break. Doing this in increments is also helpful so you don't burnout.


**How do you manage your time currently?**

I'm a planner so I like to write a 'to do' list where I set deadlines for myself. If I spend more time than anticipated, I make the necessary changes to the following tasks listed.


**Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?**

It works but not all the time. I sometimes give myself unrealistic deadlines because I don't take into account other things that may be going on.


**Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?**

I will definitely try out all of the different strategies to see what works and what doesn't. So far, I have at least tried the pomodoro technique and meditation. Meditation helps me a lot when I get anxious. It's something good to do before any peer pairing session where I get nervous every time.


**What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?**

My overall plan is to open up my full availability to Phase 0, learn from my peers in what works for them and to create better habits for myself. Also,  I want to incorporate some of these time management techniques in my sessions so my peer and I can check that we are understanding everything and are on the same page.



<h3>1.2 The Command Line</h3>

**What is a shell? What is "bash?"**

“Shell” is the command line or terminal where you type in your commands. “Bash” is the command used on the terminal that can allow you to do something such as create a new folder.


**What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**

Fortunately, I played around with command lines before. However, this time I was met with commands I’ve never seen before. The most challenging lesson had to be ‘Finding Files.’ 


**Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**

Yes.


**In your opinion, what are the most important arguments to know?**

I feel that the most important arguments to know are pwd, cd, ls, mkdir, touch, mv, and rm. I think those are the most important because those are the most common functions. One can easily check which file one is in, create a new folder or file and move or remove certain files. It seems to make the process of navigating through files smoother.


**Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**

-`pwd`
“Print working directory” : Shows the location of the file you are currently in

-`ls`
-ls
“List directory” : Gives a list of the files/folders within the folder one is in

-`grep`
Finds a specific document

-`mv`
move files

-`cd`
Goes to a directory

-`../`
directory before the current one

-`touch`
creates a file

-`mkdir`
"make directory" : Makes a new folder

-`echo`
copies words

-`less`
Way of looking through a file and searching for specific data

-`rmdir`
"remove directory" : deletes a folder

-`cat`
In another screen, shows you what a file contains

-`rm`
remove

-`help`
shows what comand does what

-`exit`
closes down terminal


<h3>1.4 Forking and Cloning</h3>

**Click on Fork from a repository you want to copy on Github (top right)**
**Copy repository URL(https...) from clipboard (bottom right)**
**In the terminal, type 'git clone https... '**

I struggled with defining the difference between git and Github. When I used them before I didn't know their individual purpose. I learned that git is a type of version control and Github is a hub where files could be sent to and shared with others.

My 'Aha' moment was when I finally differentiated the two. Previously, I used GitBash so I thought git and github was the same thing.

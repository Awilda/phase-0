**What does puts do?**

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

An integer is a number without a decimal and a float is a number with a decimal.

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

A float in a division will return the exact number- decimals and all. For instance 8 / 2 will return 4.0(remember, a float has decimals) and 9 / 2 will return 4.5. Now, since integers don't have decimals, 8 / 2 would return 4 and 9 / 2 will also return 4. As weird as that may look, 2 happens to go into 9 four times. That's how integers will be read when doing a division and at times can make sense. For example, if you had $20 and wanted to by a few cans of paint that cost $6, how many cans would you be able to buy? 3 - not 3.3333 cans because it just doesn't work that way.
